        <h1>I Enjoy Making Things Better</h1>
        <h2>One Example: Legos</h2>
        <p>
            One great way for me to improve things is to make things out of legos and make them better as a I get new ideas. I have made a laptop stand currently, and as I need new things for it I can add them, making a better laptop stand. Some of the current features that I have added are: a holder for a powered hub, a little container for adapters and my 64 GB thumb drive, and some pillars and sections underneath to route cords for better cable management.
            <br>
            One of the main things limiting me right now is the amount of legos I have. If I had more then I could keep going, adding more and more things to my laptop stand making it better and better. So far the best course of action is to keep adding more
