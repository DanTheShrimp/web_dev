        <h2>One Example: Legos</h2>
        <p>
            One great way for me to improve things is to make things out of legos and make them better as a I get new ideas. I have made a laptop stand currently, and as I need new things for it I can add them, making a better laptop stand.
         </p>
         <dl>
            <dt>Some of the current features that I have added are:</dd>
            <dd>A holder for a powered hub</dd>
            <dd>A little container for adapters and my 64 GB thumb drive</dd>
            <dd>Some pillars and sections underneath to route cords for better cable management</dd>
            <dd>Two crossbeams made of bricks holding the two sides together</dd>
            <dd>Tiles on the parts that are holding up the laptop to not scratch it.</dd>
         </dl>
         <p>
            One of the main things limiting me right now is the amount of legos I have. If I had more then I could keep going, adding more and more things to my laptop stand making it better and better. So far the best course of action is to keep adding more attachments until I can't anymore.

        <h2>Life Examples</h2>
          <p>
          I actively strive to make myself better. I achieve this through watching other people and if they do something I don't agree with, I just work to not do what they did. This helps me become the best person I can be (in my eyes), and this makes me feel good about myself and my morals. Making myself better also allows me to be a better friend. Wanting to do better means I am a better friend in general because I adjust myself to just be better. Being a better friend means I don't lose my friends, like I did in my childhood.
